##Where Did I Go Wrong?
- I listened to my <span style="color:yellow">~~idiot~~</span> users

--
- Specifically I failed to do the following:
1. Collect distinct and measureable requirements
2. Work with the team
3. Give it in stages so they can give feedback
---
# Step 1: What They Say != The Problem
- What is the problem that you are trying to solve?

# Let's Take Some Bad Objectives and Make Them Not Bad
- <span style="color:red">"Let us explore the data" </span>

--
- "<span style="color:green">Lower the amount of adhoc requests given to the department by 20%" </span>

--

- <span style="color:red">"I want instanaeous access to the data" </span>

--

- "<span style="color:green">Decrease time to a decision point by 2 days" </span>
--

- <span style="color:red">"Free up Carl to do other stuff" </span>

--

- "<span style="color:green"> Work done on Project X is increased by 30% due to Carl's availability </span>"

# Step 2: Investigate Alternatives
- Why not use?
- Tableau, JMP, Power BI, Spotfire, A Well Trained Dog
- Your dashboard will never be as good as these.
--

- **Except JMP. It will be probably be better than JMP**
---

# Step 3: Whiteboard the UI!
- Have **them** draw the UI on a whiteboard
- I like to program the entire UI (no server) and let them play with it before I start the real coding.

#Write up a requirements document
- Goal:
- What it will do
- What it won't do

# Step 4: Don't let them add anything
- Once they get a taste of an additional feature, they will **never stop**.

#Of course, I don't live in a fantasy world
- Design using modules so you don't blow up anything else
---
#How do you design an app?
- I like to define an shiny app as doing X action, Y different ways, with Z parameters
---
#For example
- Simulate X distributions
- Do descriptive and inferential statistics
---
# Minimize the damage
---
# Questions?
